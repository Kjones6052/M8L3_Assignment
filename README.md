# **Hello, World!**

The files contained in this repository are my assignment for CSS Layout Design, Module 8 Lesson 3.

For this assignment I reused the webpages that were originally designed for the Personal Portfolio mini-project, and with these HTML documents I added and adjusted things to fit the tasks outlined to be completed in this assignment.

What was done, changes that were made, and what pages are affected by these changes:
Part 1 Task 1: styles.css was used to make design changes to home.html to include a flexbox style layout including: a header with background image and bold text centered, a horizontal navigation bar containing at least 3 items, a main content section with 2 children divs each with content and stacked on top of each other vertically, and a footer with at least 3 items. 

Part 1 Task 2: styles.css was used to make design changes to home.html to modify the design layout for screens under 600px using Responsive Web Design (RWD).

Part 1 Task 3: styles.css was used to make design changes to home.html to include justify-content, align-items, and flex-grow properties.

Part 2 Task 1: styles.css was used to make design changes to about_me.html to include a grid based layout featuring a header, a main section with 2 columns, and a footer.

Part 2 Task 2: styles.css was used to make design changes to about_me.html to modify the display for screens under 768px, changing from 2 columns to 1 column. 

Part 2 Task 3: styles.css was used to make design changes to about_me.html to add grid-template-columns and grid-template-rows utilizing Fractional Units (fr) and fixed sizes (pixels).

All of the CSS styling code is located in the styles.css file, and is used to change the disign and display for the pages home.html and about_me.html. All other HTML documents in this repository are unchanged and included ony to provide nav link functionality.
