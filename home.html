            <p>
                My name is Kyle Jones, and I've been a real estate agent for the last 7 years, but never really found that industry to be interesting or enjoyable. I 
                have had a long standing interest in learning how to code, and in August of 2024 I enrolled with Coding Temple to begin my journey into coding. At Coding 
                Temple I've learned how to use programming languages like Python, SQL, and HTML to build applications, databases, and websites. The journey has been a lot 
                of fun but also challenging, and I look forward to doing more projects and working in the tech industry as a software engineer.

                This section was added to satisfy the requirement for the main section to consist of 2 child divs with content to be arranged vertically on the page. Shout
                out to Coding Temple for everything I've learned so far and everything I have yet to learn still. Can't wait to continue this wonderful journey in the world
                of coding and software engineering.
